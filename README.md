Weekly Progression Summary
Here's a summary timeline of the weekly progression plan (assuming ~5 hours per week, adjust as needed):
Week 1: Node intro, installation, “Hello World” scripts, npm basics.
Week 2: JS refresh, module system, core modules (fs, path, http), simple HTTP server, CLI project.
Week 3: Async programming (callbacks/promises/async-await), basic event loop concept, timers, build simple async scripts.
Week 4: Error handling patterns, debugging Node apps, improve CLI with robust error handling.
Week 5: Intro to web servers; build Express “Hello World” and basic routes.
Week 6: (Optional UI) Use templating in Express to serve HTML, or skip to Week 7 if only API-focused.
Week 7: Event loop deep dive (phases, nextTick, etc.), experiment with ordering, understand internals.
Week 8: Streams and EventEmitters, build a streaming file server, possibly basic chat with net module.
Week 9: Database integration (SQL) – connect and do CRUD from Node.
Week 10: Database integration (NoSQL) – try MongoDB or an alternative. Integrate into project.
Week 11: Testing – set up Jest/Mocha, write unit and integration tests for previous projects.
Week 12: Performance – profile app, identify blocking code, learn cluster/worker threads.
Week 13: Security – implement Helmet, handle auth (JWT), validate inputs, study common vulns.
Week 14: Advanced testing (coverage, E2E), set up CI for automated testing.
Week 15: Explore a second framework (NestJS or Koa) – get basic familiarity.
Week 16: Non-web focus 1 – e.g., CLI tooling (improve CLI app with commander.js).
Week 17: Non-web focus 2 – e.g., Electron desktop app or Socket.io real-time feature.
Week 18: Deployment – deploy app to Heroku or similar, learn PM2, environment configs.
Week 19+: Specialize & keep learning – follow interests (TypeScript, GraphQL, microservices, etc.), contribute to projects, build more.
